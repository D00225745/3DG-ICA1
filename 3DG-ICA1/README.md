Quick Story:
Because Pate stole from the Mage King's belongings, The King flew into a rage and unleashed his magic, causing the lands between to warp due to The Mage King's spell.

If he catches you, who knows what'll happen to you...
So run Pate, run!!

Updated Story:
Pate got caught pickpocketing a Mage. For punishment, Pate got sent into a pocket dimension with magic.

Now he has to run around and explore in order to find some way out of this unnatural pocket dimension used by the mage to hoard any object they deem of interest.

He might interact with NPC's such as wisps or others who were similarly whisked away into this world by the mage (these may serve as npc that give Pate lore etc)

Also Rare/Dangerous monsters and creatures that may seek to harm Pate during his journey.
